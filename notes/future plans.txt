Intended to define future work both in and out of camera manager
----------------------------------------------------------------

Transition CM and things that use it (rover side only) to ZMQ
 - look at old commits for this
 - Will need to get people working with YOLO on board

Fix Decoder (if I haven't already)
 - No legitimate reason to be using FFMPEG but have not been able to get encoder-decoder pair working
 - See if we can use something nicer than H264 and run the options comprehensively
