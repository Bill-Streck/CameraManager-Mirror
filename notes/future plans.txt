Transition CM and things that use it (rover side only) to ZMQ
 - look at old commits for this
 - Will need to get people working with YOLO on board
 - Please reach out to me (williamrstreck@gmail.com) if I am not here while this is being developed and you need help.

Fix Decoder (if I haven't already)
 - No legitimate reason to be using FFMPEG but have not been able to get encoder-decoder pair working
    - XXX I'll link the example project I worked off of.
 - See if we can use something nicer than H264 and run the options comprehensively
